# DOMContentLoaded
jQuery equivalent `$(document).ready()` with no dependencies or external variables.

Can be placed in the `<head>` or the `<body>`, although for obvious reasons it should be placed in the `<head>`

Usage:

```html
<script>
DOMContentLoaded(function(e) {
  // your code here
});
</script>

```
